# RadioControl

**Root Required!**

I created this app because of the lack of apps on the play store that enable airplane mode, while keeping wifi on. Probably because not many carriers have WiFi calling and SMS over WiFi

RadioControl automatically toggles WiFi and Cell radios to maximize battery life

This app will be useful to Project Fi and Republic Wireless users, as both carriers support Talk & Text through wifi.

# Battery Usage by RadioControl

I have only detected a 0.3% decrease in battery with regular day to day use.

I will continue testing and possibly have an average battery usage(on my phone) per week
